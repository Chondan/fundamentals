# Multithreading and Multiprocessing Programming

 - Multiprocessing
 	- A multiprocessing has more than two processors. The CPUs are added to the system that helps to increase the computing speed of the system.
 	- Every CPU has its own set of registers and main memory.

- Multithreading
	- Multithreading is a program execution technique that allows a single process to have multiple code segments (like threads).
	- It also runs concurrently withing the 'context' of that process.
	- Multi-threaded applications are applications that have two or more threads that run concurrently. Therefore, it is also know as concurrency.
