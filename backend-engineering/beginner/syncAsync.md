- Synchronous
	- Synchronous call is Sequential. In Synchronous process the thread waits for the task to be completed and then moves to the next task Sequentially. All the tasks are completed in a single thread.

- Asynchronous
	- In Asynchronous call the thread does not waits for the task to be completed to move on to the next task. The task are run in different threads all together. These threads run in independent silos whenever silos whenever the system is free.
