## Strategy pattern

> Strategy is a behavioral design pattern that lest you define a family of algorithms, put each of them into a separate class, and make their objects interchangeable.

Strategy patter (also known as the policy) is a behavioral software design pattern that enables selecting an 
algorithm at runtime. Instead of implementing a single algorithm directly, code receives run-time 
instructions as to which in a family of algorithms to use.

## Observer pattern

## Decorator pattern

> Decorator pattern attaches additional responsibilities to an object dynamically (At runtime). Decorator provide a flexible alternative to some classes for extending functionalities.

This pattern creates a decorator class which wraps the original class and provides additional functionality keeping class methods signature intact.

## Command pattern

> The command pattern encapsulates a request as an object thereby letting you parameterize other objects with different requests queue or log request and support undo operation.
